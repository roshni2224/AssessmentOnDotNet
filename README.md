# ASPDOTNETCoreWebAPI
 
Project description: 
I have created a project to store patient information using MVC core and WEB API. In the back end application the name of the api is ‘PatientAPI2’ and in the front end ‘PatientRegisterUsingPatientAPI2’ has been used. When the two project run simultaneously, the list of patient information will be displayed in a tabular form and ‘GET’ api is used in the background 
-Create-new button : If we click this button, the ‘POST’ api will be called in the background and we can insert patient information through it.
-Edit button:  If we click this button, the ‘PUT’ api will be called in the background and we can update the patient’s information through it by taking the patient’s id as a parameter.
-Details button:  If we click this button, the ‘GET/{id}’ api will be called in the background and we can see the details of a specific patients’s information by taking the patient’s id as a parameter.
-Delete button:  If we click this button, the ‘DELETE’’ api will be called in the background and record of that specific patient's information will be deleted by taking the patient’s id as a parameter.
